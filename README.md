# Max-Sliced StarGAN
This repository contains Pytorch implementation for the _Max-Sliced StarGAN_ proposed in project [Multi-Domain Image-to-Image Translation using StarGAN with Max Sliced Wasserstein Distance](report/Multi_Domain_Image_to_Image_Translation_using_StarGAN_with_Max_Sliced_Wasserstein_Distance.pdf).

The Max-Sliced StarGAN combines [StarGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09020) and [Max-Sliced Wasserstein distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05877) together to improve the training stability and reduce sample complexity of the orginal StarGAN.

Sample images generated by the Max-Sliced StarGAN are shown here.

## Dependencies
* [Python 3.5+](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* [PyTorch 0.4.0+](http://pytorch.org/)
* [TensorFlow 1.3+](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (optional for tensorboard)

## Usage

> Note: the current version only supports training on the CelebA dataset.

### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Ziyu0/max-sliced-stargan.git
cd max-sliced-stargan
```

### Download the CelebA dataset
```
bash download.sh celeba
```

### Training

Run 
```
python main.py --help
```
to see all the configurable hyper-parameters.

#### Training the original StarGAN
```
cd scripts
bash train_celeba_original.sh
```

#### Training the Max-Sliced StarGAN
```
cd scripts
bash train_celeba_max_sliced.sh 
```
In script `train_celeba_max_sliced.sh`, `--use_max_sw_loss` is set to `True` to enable the max-sliced Wasserstein distance.

#### Training the other baseline models

> Please refer to the [report](report/Multi_Domain_Image_to_Image_Translation_using_StarGAN_with_Max_Sliced_Wasserstein_Distance.pdf) for the introduction to the baseline models

1. Training the Sliced StarGAN
    ```
    cd scripts
    bash train_celeba_sliced.sh
    ```
    In script `train_celeba_sliced.sh`, `--use_sw_loss` is set to `True` to enable the sliced Wasserstein distance.
2. Training the Sliced StarGAN with feature transformation
    ```
    cd scripts
    bash train_celeba_sliced_feat_trans.sh
    ```
    In the script `train_celeba_sliced_feat_trans.sh`, both `--use_sw_loss` and `--use_d_feature` are set to `True` so that we can compute the sliced Wasserstein distance based on the feature transformation.

### Testing
#### Testing on all images from the test dataset
```
cd scripts
bash test_celeba_general.sh 
```

#### Testing on on a small subset of the images from the test dataset
```
cd scripts
bash test_celeba_small.sh
```

### Plot
To generate loss plots for multiple training processes, run
```
cd scripts
bash create_plots.sh
```

Here is a sample plot:
